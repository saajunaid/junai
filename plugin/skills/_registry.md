### Workflow

| Skill | Path | When to Use |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Best Practices | `best-practices/` | >- |
| Brainstorming | `brainstorming/` | You MUST use this before any creative work - creating features, building components, adding functionality, or modifying behavior. Explores user intent, requirements and design before implementation. |
| Context Curator | `context-curator/` | Compress and prioritize codebase context before handing work to reasoning agents, minimizing token waste while preserving the required decision inputs. |
| Golden Plan | `golden-plan/` | USE THIS SKILL whenever a user asks for a comprehensive implementation plan, a full-stack build plan, a UI+backend plan, or says 'create a plan for building X' where X spans multiple phases or systems. Also activate when the user says 'plan this project', 'I need a detailed plan', 'build plan', 'implementation plan', or attaches a mockup/wireframe and asks how to build it. Produces a zero-ambiguity, evidence-gated plan with self-contained per-phase prompts, exhaustive data binding tables, per-phase validation checklists, and a global quality gate. Evidence-gated: before writing phases, verify required artefacts (mockup, data sample, API contract, scaffold inventory); if any BLOCKER is missing, ask for it and wait before proceeding. Dual-mode: generic by default, junai-pipeline only when explicitly requested. Agent-agnostic - any agent with read/search/edit tools can use this skill. |
| Preflight | `preflight/` | Plan-vs-codebase validation — verifies API contracts, type names, field accuracy, dependencies, and paths before implementation begins |
| Skill Creator | `skill-creator/` | Create new skills, modify and improve existing skills, and measure skill performance. Use when users want to create a skill from scratch, edit, or optimize an existing skill, run evals to test a skill, benchmark skill performance with variance analysis, or optimize a skill's description for better triggering accuracy. |
